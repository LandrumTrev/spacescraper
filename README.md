#### SpaceScraper scrapes the latest space news headlines from spacenews.com and has a basic login to allow user attribution in the comments section of each story card. 

SpaceScraper is a responsive web design, MVC structured app, using Heroku's mLab MongoDB queried with the Mongoose ODM. Basic login functionality stores the username in local storage and populates the username field of each comment input form. Server-side data templating with Handlebars and event handling with jQuery. JavaScript, Mongoose, Axios, and Cheerio used on HTML and API routes. Axios performs server-side HTML GET calls to retrieve web page data, while Cheerio performs jQuery-like data parsing on the data returned by Axios. Express server running on Node with npm, version control via GitHub. Bootstrap components with custom CSS and Font Awesome icons.
